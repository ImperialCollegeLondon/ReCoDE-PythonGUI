The GUI framework we use in this course is dearpygui, here is a link to the domentation of dearpygui.Dearpygui is chosen for its ability to create a GUI with a few lines of code. It is also a very powerful GUI framework that can be used to create a complex GUI. Most importantly, it supports GPU rendering and multi-threading, which makes it very fast and responsive.
