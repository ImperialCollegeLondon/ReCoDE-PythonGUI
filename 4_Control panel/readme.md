## Python GUI programming Day 4
For the past three days we have learned how to create a GUI and display data. Today we will learn how to control the GUI. The control panel is the most important part of the GUI. It allows you to control the data acquisition and display.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the control panel to control the GUI. We will also learn how to use the control panel to control the data acquisition and display. We will make modifications based on ```Python_GUI_day3.py```.

The control panel contains three functions:

1. Select the data file to be displayed
2. Start, stop and pause data display
3. Select the channels to be activated
4. Adjust the x-axis range and y-axis range of the display
