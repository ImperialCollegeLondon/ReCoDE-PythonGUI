## Python GUI programming Day 2
In this session we are going to create a GUI that displays a single channel of data. The widget we need is plotting widget, which is used to display the data. 

The trick is to repalce ```start_dearpygui()``` with 
```python
while dpg.is_dearpygui_running():
    ### function to be executed ###
    dpg.render_dearpygui_frame()
```

Two python files are provided.
* `python_gui_day2_simple.py` is to plot data generated by program.
* `python_gui_day2_file.py` is to plot data from file.

### Hints for open-source data
There are many open-source databases available online. Different databases have different data format. Here we choose one of the most commonly used open-source databased for physiological data. The data is from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ptbdb/). There is a special data format for data from Physionet. You will learn how to read the data use wfdb library provided by Physionet.
